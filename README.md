### About

This is basically just a little pet project of mine, I put it on GitHub because why not. More of a software than hardware project at this point in time.

#### Hardware details

 - **Raspberry Pi**: Pi 3 Model B
 - **Chassis:** Some kit I got off of [eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Smart-Car-Motor-Robot-Chassis-Ultrasonic-Module-Battery-Model-Kit-For-Arduino/143617734608?hash=item217048b7d0:g:kH8AAOSwmf5e0P8g) (you can find them all over the internet), hoping to 3D print one in the future.
